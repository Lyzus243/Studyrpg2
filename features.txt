üß† Future Feature Consideration
Would you like help adding:

Admin user adds quests for the group. 


Shop functionality. Payment with XP.



Subscription features.

Achievement System: Badges and milestones.
 inventorypage has two sections: One for Items owned/purchased from the shop/ The second to store, and display the achievement system of the user

Notifications: In-app or email updates for events (like invites or quest completions).


Gamified Level-Up Animations (JS/CSS on frontend).

API Versioning for long-term maintenance.

Admin Dashboard to manage users, groups, content.

Automatic role upgrade (e.g. from ‚Äúmember‚Äù to ‚Äúveteran‚Äù) based on XP or quests completed?


Skill tree CRUD functions (if implementing ability unlocks)?
