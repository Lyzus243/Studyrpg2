 the Updated STUDYRPG2.zip couldn't be generated properly.

 Thanks for pointing that out — let’s fix it right away.

The issue likely came from the fact that the original app/ and templates/ folders were extracted earlier but may no longer be present in the /mnt/data/ directory after session resets or operations.

✅ Fix Plan:
Re-extract both original zips:

app.zip

templates.zip

Re-apply all updates (if not persisted)

Zip everything again as Updated STUDYRPG2.zip

Let me now:

Re-extract both zip files

Verify their contents

Rebuild the working project structure

Proceeding to re-extract app.zip and templates.zip now.
